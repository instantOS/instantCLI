# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

InstantCLI is a Rust-based command-line tool (v0.1.10) for managing dotfiles, game saves, system settings, and instantOS configurations. It provides a decentralized approach to dotfile management that respects user modifications while enabling easy theme and configuration switching, along with comprehensive system management capabilities.

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Installation
```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Install locally (builds and copies to ~/.local/bin/)
just install

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with debug output
cargo run -- --debug <command>
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test
just test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_apply_and_fetch

# Install locally for user testing (builds and copies to ~/.local/bin/)
just install
```

### User Testing
For testing purposes, you can install the CLI locally and use it as a normal user would:

```bash
# Install the CLI (builds and installs to ~/.local/bin/)
just install

# Test from home directory (simulates real user usage)
cd ~ && ins <command>

# Example test commands
cd ~ && ins dot status
cd ~ && ins --debug dot apply
cd ~ && ins dot reset .config
```

**Note**: Using `cd ~ && ins <command>` is the preferred testing method as it simulates how real users will interact with the CLI, avoiding working directory concerns and ensuring the tool behaves correctly in normal usage scenarios.

**Important Note**: Commands involving fzf interactive menus (such as `ins menu` commands and any dotfile operations that require user selection) should be run by the user directly. AI agents are not capable of interacting with fzf's interactive interface, so these commands must be executed manually by a human user.

### Key Concepts

**Dotfile Structure**: 
- Repositories contain a `dots/` directory mirroring home directory structure
- Example: `dots/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` installs to `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`

**Multi-Repository Support**:
- Multiple dotfile repos can be configured with priority-based overlaying
- Later repos override earlier ones for the same file paths

**User Modification Protection**:
- SHA256 hashes track file states in SQLite database with explicit source/target distinction
- User-modified files are never overwritten automatically
- Files are only updated if they are determined to be unmodified using hash comparison

### Hash System Architecture

The hash system distinguishes between **source files** (in dotfile repositories) and **target files** (in home directory):

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE file_hashes (
    created TEXT NOT NULL,
    hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    path TEXT NOT NULL,
    source_file INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- true=source file, false=target file
    PRIMARY KEY (hash, path)
)
```

**DotFileType Enum**:
- `SourceFile` (serializes as `true`): Files in the dotfile repository (`~/.local/share/instantos/dots/`)
- `TargetFile` (serializes as `false`): Files in the home directory (`~/`)

**Modification Detection Logic**:
The `is_target_unmodified()` function determines if a target file can be safely overwritten:

**Returns true (safe to overwrite) if**:
1. **File doesn't exist** - Can be safely created
2. **File was created by instantCLI** - Hash matches any source file hash in database
3. **File matches current source** - Hash matches current source file hash

**Returns false (user modification detected) if**:
- File exists, has been modified by user, and doesn't match current source

### Configuration Structure

TOML config at `~/.config/instant/instant.toml`:
```toml
clone_depth = 1  # Default git clone depth

[[repos]]
url = "https://github.com/user/dotfiles.git"
name = "my-dotfiles"
branch = "main"
```

## Important Agent Policies

**No Git Commits**: Do NOT create git commits. The repository has strict policies against automated commits. If changes need to be committed, ask the user for explicit permission.

**Compile After Changes**: Always compile the code after making changes to verify correctness with the compiler. Use `cargo check` for quick syntax checks or `cargo build` for full compilation.

**Hash-Based Safety**: All file operations respect the hash-based modification detection system. Never bypass this system as it protects user modifications. The system distinguishes between source files (repository copies) and target files (home directory installations) using the `source_file` database field.

**Config Locations**: 
- Config: `~/.config/instant/instant.toml`
- Database: `~/.local/share/instantos/instant.db` 
- Repos: `~/.local/share/instantos/dots/`

## Multiple Subdirectories Support

InstantCLI repositories can declare multiple subdirectories containing dotfiles, with configurable active subdirectories per repository.

### Repository Structure

Repositories can define multiple dots directories in their `instantdots.toml`:

```toml
name = "my-dotfiles"
description = "My personal dotfiles collection"
dots_dirs = ["dots", "themes", "configs"]
```

### Active Subdirectories Configuration

The global configuration can specify which subdirectories are active for each repository:

```toml
[[repos]]
url = "https://github.com/user/dotfiles.git"
name = "my-dotfiles"
active_subdirs = ["dots", "themes"]
```

### Default Behavior

- If `dots_dirs` is not specified in `instantdots.toml`, defaults to `["dots"]`
- If `active_subdirs` is not specified in global config, defaults to `["dots"]`
- Only the first subdirectory is active by default to maintain backward compatibility
- Later repositories override earlier ones for the same file paths (overlay system)
