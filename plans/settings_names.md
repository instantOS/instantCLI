Some settings can be named better. 

The `ins settings` command is meant to be usable by non-technical users,
beginners when it comes to linux. Some of the names and settings are not trivial
for them and could use better names and hierarchy. 

Think about which settings someone coming from windows, Ubuntu, android or MacOS
or iOS would search for, which ones are used frequently, what the settings
should be called, what the hierarchy should be. 

For example, instead of "inode/directory - Directory" someone would search for
"Default Applications" and "File Manager", so make sure these commonly used
terms and descriptions are there.
Other things one might look for is

Setting the default browser
Email App

etc.
