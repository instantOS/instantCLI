I want an `ins dev setup` command whichs setup a development environment for
debuggin within an arch live iso. It should first check if it is in a live iso
(there are existing utils for this) and then do the following:

install zsh, git, mise, neovim

clone and apply the default instantOS dotfiles (look through the repo on how to
do that)


also install opencode by running the following:

```
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```
