# Add a networking section to `ins settings`

Look at the old settings for reference. 
I want to replace the speedtest with a call to https://fast.com with chromium,
look at how cockpit is handled for reference. 
Also port over the ip info section, use the fzf wrapper message util to display
the results.

"Edit connections" should be similar, make use of the dependency utils, and also
look how other settings launch GUI apps for reference.
