read how the printer settings are implemented in old_settings and implemen an
equivalent for the `ins settings` command in the new codebase. Look up if the
old printer settings contain anything deprecated or wrong, they are a couple of
years old. The new implementation is supposed to be state of the art and modern. It only needs linux compatibility.
