# New command idea

`instant game setup` command, choose game which has been added, but which does
not have an entry in the installations file

list potential folders where the game saves should be installed, with list of
other, then create entry in installations md

Different snapshots from different devices contain different paths where the
game is located on that device. Sort and make unique, this is the list of
possible locations. 


# TODO research

Is this actually how restic snapshots work? Check that!
