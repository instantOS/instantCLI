# ins game restoers for wine

Some game saves are made from wine prefixes. Wine prefixes are a path which
contains all data wine needs to simulate a windows installation.

an exampl would be the following path for a game save snapshot. The game in this
example is Twin Mirror.
```
/media/benjamin/hdddrive/Games/twin_mirror/prefix/drive_c/users/benjamin/AppData/Local/LOA/Saved
```

Relative to the wine prefix, the game save always has the same path on all
machines, but the location of the prefix can be different between machines.
