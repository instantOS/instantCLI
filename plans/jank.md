printer has a bunch of package ensure calls, they should be batched (a list of
packages should have an ensure like method)

to install the package anyway. 

non-utf8 locales are present in the settings menu

clipboard menu starts off as on even though the clipmenu is not installed,
pressing it install the clip menu but then disables the setting
