The server version of the menu does not accept previews for the items. 
Come up with a plan to make the server and normal version of the chooser have
more feature parity and maybe share more code. Instead of sending an array of
string, an array of a struct instances with the selectable trait would maybe be
better. Come up with a plan to do this, do not write code yet, only describe the
steps to do this. Put the steps in this file.
